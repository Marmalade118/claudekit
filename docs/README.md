## Key Features

### üöÄ Slash Commands
Powerful commands for common development tasks:
- `/checkpoint:create` - Create git checkpoints for safe experimentation
- `/git:status` - Intelligent git status with insights
- `/spec:create` - Generate comprehensive feature specifications
- `/validate-and-fix` - Automated code quality checks and fixes

### üîÑ Automated Hooks
Real-time validation as you code:
- **TypeScript** - Type checking and 'any' type detection
- **ESLint** - Linting with auto-fix support
- **Testing** - Run relevant tests on changes
- **Checkpoints** - Auto-save progress points

### ü§ñ AI Subagents
Specialized AI assistants for specific domains:
- **Build Tools**: webpack-expert, vite-expert
- **TypeScript**: typescript-expert, typescript-build-expert
- **React**: react-expert, react-performance-expert
- **Testing**: jest-testing-expert, playwright-expert
- **Infrastructure**: docker-expert, github-actions-expert

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Create a checkpoint
/checkpoint:create Starting feature X

# Generate specification
/spec:create user authentication system

# Hooks automatically validate code as you work
```

### Code Quality & Commits
```bash
# Validate and fix issues
/validate-and-fix

# Review changes
/git:status

# Create conventional commit
/git:commit
```

### Working with Subagents
Use specialized AI assistants for domain-specific tasks:
```bash
# React performance issues
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "react-performance-expert"

# Complex TypeScript types
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "typescript-type-expert"

# Webpack configuration
Use Task tool with subagent_type: "webpack-expert"
```

## Architecture Overview

claudekit is built around three core components:

1. **Commands** - Slash commands that provide reusable prompts and workflows
2. **Hooks** - Event-driven automation that runs during development
3. **Subagents** - Specialized AI assistants with deep domain expertise

All components are designed to be:
- **Self-contained** - No external dependencies
- **Project-agnostic** - Work with any codebase
- **Configurable** - Adapt to your specific needs
- **Extensible** - Easy to add custom functionality

## Configuration Files

### Project-Level Configuration
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration and project settings
- `.claude/commands/` - Project-specific slash commands

### User-Level Configuration
- `~/.claude/settings.json` - Global environment variables
- `~/.claude/commands/` - Personal slash commands

## Support and Contributing

### Getting Help
- Check [Troubleshooting](getting-started/troubleshooting.md) for common issues
- Review relevant guides for your specific use case
- Use the `/oracle` command in Claude Code for complex queries

### Contributing
- Follow the patterns established in existing commands and hooks
- Test thoroughly with `npm run build` after changes
- Use self-contained scripts that don't require external dependencies
- Document new features with clear examples

## Environment Requirements

- **OS**: macOS/Linux with bash 4.0+
- **Required**: Git, Node.js/npm
- **Optional**: GitHub CLI, jq (with fallbacks provided)

## Next Steps

1. **New Users**: Start with [Installation](getting-started/installation.md)
2. **Customization**: Learn [Creating Commands](guides/creating-commands.md) and [Creating Hooks](guides/creating-hooks.md)
3. **Advanced Usage**: Explore [Subagents](guides/creating-subagents.md) and [Integrations](integrations/)
4. **Development**: Review [Internals](internals/) for technical details
