## Core Principle: Domain Experts Over Task Specialists

The most effective agents are **domain experts** that handle multiple related problems within their area of expertise. These can be organized hierarchically, with broad domain experts providing general coverage and optional sub-domain experts offering deep specialization.

This hierarchy keeps agent selection manageable while allowing deep expertise where needed. Projects might have 10-20 agents total, but organized as 5-7 broad experts with selected sub-domain specialists.

Why domain experts instead of specific task agents? Specific tasks (like “fix circular dependencies” or “optimize bundle size”) are better handled by explicit slash commands that users invoke when needed. This keeps the agent selection pool focused while allowing unlimited specific operations.

## The Domain Expert Formula

```
Concentrated Knowledge + Environmental Adaptation + Tool Integration = Valuable Agent

```

## Creating Shareable Domain Expert Agents

### The Domain Expert Formula

```
Concentrated Knowledge + Environmental Adaptation + Tool Integration = Valuable Agent

```

### Characteristics of a Good Domain Expert

1. **Covers an Entire Problem Domain**

- Not: “Fixes TypeScript circular dependencies”
- But: “TypeScript/JavaScript architecture expert”
- Handles 5-15 related problems within the domain

1. **Has Concentrated, Non-Obvious Knowledge**

- Enumerates specific problem types
- Provides prioritized solutions
- Includes knowledge beyond base AI capabilities

1. **Adapts to Environment**

- Detects project structure and conventions
- Identifies available tools and frameworks
- Adjusts approach based on context

1. **Integrates with Tools**

- Knows which CLI tools to run
- Interprets tool output correctly
- Suggests tool installation when needed

## Boundary Heuristics: When to Create Sub-Domain Experts

### The Core Question

“Does this area have enough distinct characteristics to warrant its own expert, or is it just another problem within the parent domain?”

### Primary Boundary Indicators

### 1. **Tool Boundaries**

**Strong indicator for separation when different tools are used**

✅ **Separate Sub-Domain**: TypeScript Types vs Build

- Type issues: TypeScript compiler, playground, type utilities
- Build issues: Webpack, Vite, Rollup, bundler-specific tools
- Different tool expertise = different experts

❌ **Keep Together**: React Hooks vs Components

- Both use React DevTools, same debugging approach
- Same tool ecosystem = same expert

### 2. **Mental Model Boundaries**

**Separate when thinking patterns are fundamentally different**

✅ **Separate Sub-Domain**: SQL Performance vs Database Design

- Performance: Execution plans, query optimization, indexes
- Design: Normalization, relationships, data modeling
- Different thinking = different experts

❌ **Keep Together**: TypeScript Generics vs Conditional Types

- Both require type-level thinking
- Similar mental model = same expert

### 3. **Documentation/Learning Path Boundaries**

**Separate when people learn these independently**

✅ **Separate Sub-Domain**: Jest vs Vitest

- Separate documentation sites
- Different configuration approaches
- Framework-specific patterns
- People often know one, not both

❌ **Keep Together**: useEffect vs useState

- Same React hooks documentation
- Learned together as part of React
- Interdependent concepts

### 4. **Specialist Role Boundaries**

**Separate when companies hire different people for these**

✅ **Separate Sub-Domain**: Frontend Performance vs Security

- Performance engineer role
- Security engineer role
- Distinct specializations in industry

❌ **Keep Together**: API Design patterns

- Same backend developer handles all
- Not typically separate roles

### 5. **Problem Frequency × Complexity Matrix**

```
High Frequency + High Complexity → Definitely separate subdomain
High Frequency + Low Complexity → Keep in parent domain
Low Frequency + High Complexity → Maybe separate (if tools differ)
Low Frequency + Low Complexity → Keep in parent domain

```

Examples:

- TypeScript type errors: High frequency + High complexity → **Separate**
- Git merge conflicts: High frequency + Low complexity → **Keep in git-expert**
- Webpack optimization: Low frequency + High complexity + Special tools → **Separate**

### Secondary Boundary Indicators

### 6. **Solution Pattern Boundaries**

**Separate when solutions follow completely different approaches**

✅ **Different Patterns**: Database query optimization vs schema design

- Query optimization: Analyze → Index → Rewrite
- Schema design: Model → Normalize → Migrate

❌ **Similar Patterns**: Different React state management libraries

- All follow: State → Actions → Updates

### 7. **Dependency Boundaries**

**Separate when you can master one without knowing the other**

✅ **Independent**: TypeScript types vs TypeScript build

- Can be type expert without build knowledge
- Can optimize builds without type mastery

❌ **Dependent**: React components vs React props

- Can’t understand one without the other

### Practical Decision Framework

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Do they use different primary tools?**

- Yes → Likely separate sub-domain
- No → Continue to #2

1. **Would someone specialize in just this area?**

- Yes → Likely separate sub-domain
- No → Continue to #3

1. **Is there separate, substantial documentation?**

- Yes → Likely separate sub-domain
- No → Continue to #4

1. **High frequency + High complexity problems?**

- Yes → Consider separate sub-domain
- No → Keep in parent domain

### Examples Applied

**TypeScript Domain Breakdown**:

- `typescript-expert` (parent): General TS, common errors, setup
- `typescript-type-expert`: Different tools ✓, specialists exist ✓, complex ✓
- `typescript-build-expert`: Different tools ✓, separate docs ✓
- ❌ `typescript-decorator-expert`: Same tools ✗, too narrow ✗

**Testing Domain Breakdown**:

- `testing-expert` (parent): General patterns, strategies
- `test-jest-expert`: Different tool ✓, separate docs ✓
- `test-e2e-expert`: Different tools ✓, different patterns ✓
- ❌ `test-mocking-expert`: Pattern not tool ✗, applies across frameworks ✗

**Database Domain Breakdown**:

- `database-expert` (parent): General SQL, design principles
- `database-postgres-expert`: Specific tool ✓, unique features ✓
- `database-performance-expert`: Different mindset ✓, specialists exist ✓
- ❌ `database-joins-expert`: Too narrow ✗, part of general SQL ✗

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Feature-Based Splitting**: `react-hooks-expert`, `react-context-expert`

- These are features, not domains with distinct tools/patterns

❌ **Problem-Based Splitting**: `fix-circular-deps-expert`

- Single problem, not a domain of related problems

❌ **Version-Based Splitting**: `react-18-expert`, `react-19-expert`

- Versions change, knowledge transfers

✅ **Tool/Pattern-Based Splitting**: `test-jest-expert`, `typescript-type-expert`

- Clear boundaries, distinct expertise

### The Litmus Test

Before creating a sub-domain expert, ask:

> “Would someone put ‘[X] Expert’ on their resume as a distinct specialization?”

- “TypeScript Type System Expert” ✓
- “Jest Testing Expert” ✓
- “PostgreSQL Performance Expert” ✓
- “React Hooks Expert” ✗
- “JavaScript Loops Expert” ✗

If it sounds like a legitimate specialization, it’s probably a good sub-domain boundary.

### The Sub-Domain Hierarchy

Effective agent organization uses a hierarchy where broad domain experts provide general coverage and sub-domain experts offer deep expertise for specific areas:

```
typescript-expert (broad - handles general TS issues)
├── typescript-type-expert (deep - type system mastery)
├── typescript-build-expert (deep - compilation & bundling)
└── typescript-module-expert (deep - dependencies & imports)

testing-expert (broad - general testing guidance)
├── test-jest-expert (deep - Jest-specific patterns)
├── test-vitest-expert (deep - Vitest-specific features)
└── test-e2e-expert (deep - Playwright/Cypress)

```

**Why Both Levels?**

- **Fallback Coverage**: When no sub-domain matches, the broad expert handles it
- **Installation Flexibility**: Some projects need just the broad expert
- **Better Selection**: Claude tries specific first, falls back to general
- **Knowledge Inheritance**: Sub-domains can assume base knowledge from parent domain

### When to Create Hierarchies

Create a broad + sub-domain hierarchy when:

1. **The domain is vast**: Testing encompasses unit, integration, E2E, different frameworks
2. **Specialization matters**: Jest and Vitest have different patterns worth deep knowledge
3. **General issues exist**: Some testing questions aren’t framework-specific
4. **Users vary**: Some need Jest expertise, others just general testing help

### Example Hierarchies

**Language Hierarchies:**

```
typescript-expert
├── typescript-type-expert
├── typescript-build-expert
└── typescript-module-expert

python-expert
├── python-async-expert
├── python-type-expert
└── python-packaging-expert

```

**Infrastructure Hierarchies:**

```
database-expert
├── database-postgres-expert
├── database-mysql-expert
└── database-mongodb-expert

cloud-expert
├── cloud-aws-expert
├── cloud-gcp-expert
└── cloud-azure-expert

```

**Testing Hierarchies:**

```
testing-expert
├── test-jest-expert
├── test-vitest-expert
├── test-pytest-expert
└── test-e2e-expert

```

### Broad vs Sub-Domain Expert Characteristics

**Broad Domain Expert** (e.g., `typescript-expert`):

- **Coverage**: General knowledge across the entire domain
- **Depth**: Good enough to handle 80% of common issues
- **Selection**: Catches questions that don’t fit specific sub-domains
- **Knowledge**: Best practices, common patterns, general troubleshooting

**Sub-Domain Expert** (e.g., `typescript-type-expert`):

- **Coverage**: Deep expertise in specific area
- **Depth**: Handles complex, edge cases in their specialty
- **Selection**: Chosen for clearly matching problems
- **Knowledge**: Advanced techniques, specific tools, niche solutions

### Example: Testing Hierarchy in Practice

```yaml
---
name: testing-expert
description: General testing guidance across frameworks - test structure, patterns, debugging. Handles testing questions not specific to a framework.
---

I provide general testing expertise including:
- Test organization and structure
- Testing patterns (AAA, mocking, fixtures)
- Test debugging strategies
- Coverage strategies
- General best practices

I defer to specific framework experts when available.

```

```yaml
---
name: test-jest-expert
description: Deep Jest expertise - configuration, snapshots, mocking system, performance. Handles Jest-specific problems and optimizations.
---
I specialize in Jest with deep knowledge of:
  - Jest's mocking system (jest.mock, manual mocks)
  - Snapshot testing strategies and updates
  - Configuration for different environments
  - Jest-specific performance optimizations
  - Custom matchers and extensions
  - Integration with TypeScript, React, etc.
```

### Installation Strategies

**Minimal Installation:**

```bash
# Just broad experts for general help
typescript-expert
testing-expert
database-expert

```

**Targeted Installation:**

```bash
# Broad + specific sub-domains you use
typescript-expert
typescript-type-expert  # Your team hits complex type issues
testing-expert
test-jest-expert       # You use Jest specifically

```

**Full Coverage:**

```bash
# Broad expert + all sub-domains

## Implementation Guidelines

### Composing Your Agent Suite

For a typical TypeScript/React project, you might select:

**Core Language Sub-Domains (3-4)**

- `typescript-type-expert` - For complex type issues
- `typescript-build-expert` - For bundling and compilation
- `javascript-module-expert` - For dependencies and structure

**Quality Sub-Domains (2-3)**

- `test-architecture-expert` - For test structure and patterns
- `webapp-security-expert` - For frontend security

**Frontend Sub-Domains (2-3)**

- `react-architecture-expert` - For component patterns
- `frontend-performance-expert` - For optimization

**Total: 7-10 focused experts** instead of trying to cover everything with 3-4 broad experts or 30+ specific agents.

### The Right Level of Specificity

✅ **Good Broad Expert**: `typescript-expert`

- Handles: General TS issues, common errors, basic guidance
- Falls back for: Questions not matching sub-domains

✅ **Good Sub-Domain Expert**: `typescript-type-expert`

- Handles: generics, conditionals, mapped types, performance, declarations
- 10+ related problems in the type system domain

❌ **Too Specific**: `typescript-generic-constraint-fixer`

- Handles: just generic constraint errors
- Better as: Part of typescript-type-expert or a slash command

✅ **Good Hierarchy**: `testing-expert` → `test-jest-expert`

- Parent handles: General testing principles
- Child handles: Jest-specific mocking, configuration, snapshots

❌ **Too Deep**: `test-jest-mock-function-expert`

- Too narrow even for a sub-domain
- Better as: Part of test-jest-expert

### Agent Count Guidelines

**Broad Domain Experts**: 5-10 total

- Core language expert
- Testing expert
- Database expert
- Frontend expert
- Infrastructure expert

**Sub-Domain Experts**: 1-4 per broad domain (selective)

- Only where deep expertise adds value
- Only for technologies you actually use
- Total: 5-15 sub-domain experts

**Project Total**: 10-20 agents is still manageable when hierarchically organized

### How Hierarchical Selection Works

When a user asks a question, Claude’s selection process would be:

1. **Check sub-domain experts first** - Most specific match
2. **Fall back to broad expert** - If no sub-domain fits
3. **Use general Claude** - If no domain expert matches

**Example Questions:**

- “How do I fix this TypeScript generic constraint error?”
  → `typescript-type-expert` (specific match)
- “What’s the best way to organize my TypeScript project?”
  → `typescript-expert` (no specific sub-domain matches)
- “How do I write good tests?”
  → `testing-expert` (general testing question)
- “How do I mock ES6 modules in Jest?”
  → `test-jest-expert` (framework-specific)

This creates a natural cascade from specific to general, ensuring the most appropriate expert handles each question.

### Measure Success

- **Agent Selection**: Is the right agent chosen 90%+ of time?
- **Usage Frequency**: Are agents used daily?
- **Time Saved**: Does each use save 10+ minutes?
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Do developers learn from agents?

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **Too Specific**: “fix-react-hooks-exhaustive-deps” → Single problem, use slash command
- **Too Generic**: “javascript-helper” → No clear domain focus
- **Too Many**: 50 agents → Consolidate into sub-domains
- **No Tools**: Knowledge without action → Add tool integration
- **No Adaptation**: Assumes setup → Detect environment

**Good Sub-Domain**: Covers 5-15 related problems with shared expertise
**Bad Specific Agent**: Covers 1-2 problems that could be slash commands

## The Ultimate Test

**For Domain Experts**: “Would I pay for monthly access to this expertise?”

**For Project Agents**: “Would new team members need this knowledge?”

If the answer is yes, it’s worth creating. Remember: the goal is 5-20 powerful domain experts that handle multiple related problems, not dozens of single-task agents.
