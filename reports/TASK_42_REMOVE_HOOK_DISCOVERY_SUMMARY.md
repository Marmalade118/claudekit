# Task 42: Remove Hook File Discovery Logic - Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed hook file discovery logic from the component discovery system, replacing it with a predefined list of embedded hooks as specified in the task requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `cli/lib/components.ts`
- **Removed**: Hook file scanning logic from `discoverComponents()` function
- **Removed**: `scanDirectory(hooksDir, 'hook')` call
- **Updated**: Component discovery to use only the predefined `EMBEDDED_HOOK_COMPONENTS` list
- **Result**: No filesystem scanning for hooks; only embedded hooks are available

### 2. Updated Test Suite `tests/lib/components.test.ts`
- **Removed**: Tests that created and expected discovery of `.sh` hook files
- **Updated**: Tests to work with embedded hooks instead of file-based hooks
- **Added**: New test to verify embedded hooks are properly included
- **Fixed**: Test expectations to account for 8 embedded hooks always being present

### Embedded Hooks Available
The following 8 hooks are now available as embedded components:
1. `typecheck` - TypeScript Type Checking
2. `eslint` - ESLint Validation
3. `prettier` - Prettier Formatting
4. `no-any` - TypeScript Any Detector
5. `run-related-tests` - Run Related Tests
6. `auto-checkpoint` - Auto Checkpoint
7. `validate-todo-completion` - Validate Todo Completion
8. `project-validation` - Project Validation

## Validation Results
- ✅ All unit tests passing (23/23 in components.test.ts)
- ✅ All integration tests passing (17/17 in setup-embedded-hooks.test.ts)
- ✅ No filesystem scanning for hooks
- ✅ Predefined hook list used instead
- ✅ All hooks still available in setup
- ✅ No broken references to discovery logic

## Impact
- **Performance**: Improved discovery performance by eliminating filesystem operations for hooks
- **Reliability**: Hooks are now guaranteed to be available (no missing file issues)
- **Consistency**: All installations have the same set of hooks
- **Migration**: Seamless - existing functionality preserved with embedded implementation

## Code Quality
- Followed project code style guidelines
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained
- Clean removal with no orphaned code
- Tests updated to reflect new behavior rather than removed

## Status
Task completed successfully. The hook discovery system now uses a predefined list of embedded hooks instead of scanning the filesystem.
