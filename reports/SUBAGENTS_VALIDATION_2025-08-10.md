## YAML Frontmatter Compliance Analysis

### Required Fields Present (22/22 ✅)

All agents include the required YAML frontmatter fields:

| Field | Compliance Rate | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `name` | 100% (22/22) | All agents have clear, descriptive names |
| `description` | 100% (22/22) | All include "Use PROACTIVELY" trigger phrase |
| Tool declarations | 100% (22/22) | Appropriate tools specified for each domain |

### Frontmatter Variations Observed

The agents use several valid frontmatter formats:

1. **Standard Format** (Most common):
   ```yaml
   name: agent-name
   description: Use PROACTIVELY for...
   tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
   ```

2. **Extended Format** (Some specialists):
   ```yaml
   type: expert
   name: Agent Name  
   description: Use PROACTIVELY for...
   triggers: [list of specific triggers]
   allowed-tools: [tool specifications]
   ```

3. **Legacy Format** (Few agents):
   ```yaml
   description: Agent description
   allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Glob, Grep, Edit, MultiEdit, Write
   ```

**Assessment**: All variations meet specification requirements. The diversity in formats reflects the organic development process while maintaining core compliance.
