# Embedded Hooks System - Task Decomposition Summary

**Generated**: 2025-07-31
**Source Specification**: specs/feat-embedded-hooks-system.md
**Task Breakdown Document**: specs/feat-embedded-hooks-system-tasks.md

## Overview

Successfully decomposed the embedded hooks system specification into 22 actionable STM tasks across 4 phases. The implementation will migrate shell script hooks to TypeScript and create a dedicated `claudekit-hooks` executable.

## Task Statistics

### Total Tasks Created: 22
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 6 tasks
- Phase 2 (Core Features): 8 tasks  
- Phase 3 (Testing & Quality): 4 tasks
- Phase 4 (Release): 4 tasks

### Complexity Distribution
- Small: 6 tasks
- Medium: 9 tasks
- Large: 7 tasks

### STM Task IDs
- Phase 1: Tasks 13-18
- Phase 2: Tasks 19-26
- Phase 3: Tasks 27-30
- Phase 4: Tasks 31-34

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Tasks 13-18)
1. **[13]** Set up TypeScript project structure
2. **[14]** Implement hooks CLI entry point
3. **[15]** Implement common hook utilities
4. **[16]** Implement base hook class
5. **[17]** Implement hook runner and configuration
6. **[18]** Update build system for dual binaries

**Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks 14 and 15 can run concurrently after task 13.

### Phase 2: Hook Implementations (Tasks 19-26)
1. **[19]** TypeScript compiler hook
2. **[20]** No-any types hook
3. **[21]** ESLint hook
4. **[22]** Auto-checkpoint hook
5. **[23]** Run-related-tests hook
6. **[24]** Project validation hook
7. **[25]** Validate-todo-completion hook
8. **[26]** Hook registry

**Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks 19-22 can run concurrently, Tasks 23-25 can run concurrently.

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Tasks 27-30)
1. **[27]** Unit tests for base infrastructure
2. **[28]** Integration tests for hooks
3. **[29]** Example configurations
4. **[30]** Documentation updates

**Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks 27-28 can run concurrently, Tasks 29-30 can run concurrently.

### Phase 4: Release Preparation (Tasks 31-34)
1. **[31]** Fix ESLint hook implementation issues
2. **[32]** Add package dependencies
3. **[33]** Test build process
4. **[34]** Create release checklist

**Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks 32-33 can run concurrently after task 31.

## Critical Path

The critical path through the project:
```
13 → 14/15 → 16 → 17 → 19-26 → 27/28 → 31 → 33 → 34
```

Estimated timeline based on complexity:
- Phase 1: 3-4 days
- Phase 2: 5-7 days (with parallelization)
- Phase 3: 3-4 days
- Phase 4: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 12-17 days

## Key Implementation Details Preserved

All STM tasks include complete implementation code:
- Full TypeScript class implementations
- Complete configuration schemas
- Detailed test structures
- Comprehensive documentation templates
- Exact command syntax and build configurations

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Dependency Management**: Task 32 can be done early to ensure packages available
2. **ESLint Hook Issues**: Task 31 addresses known implementation issues
3. **Build Process**: Task 33 validates dual binary approach before release
4. **Testing Coverage**: Both unit (27) and integration (28) tests included

## Execution Strategy

### Week 1
- Complete Phase 1 foundation (Tasks 13-18)
- Begin Phase 2 hook implementations in parallel

### Week 2  
- Complete Phase 2 hook implementations
- Run Phase 3 testing and documentation in parallel
- Begin Phase 4 release preparation

### Week 3
- Complete Phase 4 release tasks
- Final testing and release

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 22 tasks created in STM with full implementation details
- ✅ Dependencies clearly defined between tasks
- ✅ Parallel execution opportunities identified
- ✅ Complete code preserved (no summaries or references)
- ✅ Testing and documentation included
- ✅ Release process documented

## Next Steps

1. Review STM tasks using `stm list --pretty`
2. Begin execution with Phase 1 foundation tasks
3. Leverage parallel execution opportunities
4. Use `/spec:execute` command to implement with concurrent agents
