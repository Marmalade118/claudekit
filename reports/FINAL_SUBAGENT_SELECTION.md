## User Paths

### Path 1: Typical User (80%)
1. Sees initial screen → Presses Enter (Select Agents)
2. Keeps defaults → Presses Enter (Install)
3. **Result**: 10 agents installed

### Path 2: Skip User (10%)
1. Sees initial screen → Selects "Skip Agents"
2. **Result**: No agents installed

### Path 3: Power User (5%)
1. Sees initial screen → Selects "Install All"
2. **Result**: 23 agents installed

### Path 4: Customizer (5%)
1. Selects "Select Agents"
2. Changes to Vitest, adds Docker
3. **Result**: 11 agents installed

## Why This Works

1. **Clear skip option** - Users who don't want agents can skip immediately
2. **Three clear paths** - Select/All/Skip
3. **Skip available at every level** - Initial screen and selection screen
4. **Non-intrusive** - "(Optional)" in header signals it's skippable
5. **Fast for everyone** - Skip users: 1 click, Default users: 2 clicks, Power users: 1 click

## Final Design Decision

I recommend the **two-screen approach** because:

1. **Cleaner initial choice** - Three simple options
2. **Skip users don't see complexity** - They never see the tool selection screen
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Only show details to those who want them
4. **Clear mental model** - First decide if you want agents, then pick which ones

The single-screen approach shows too much to users who just want to skip, making it feel overwhelming even though it's optional.

## Non-Interactive Mode

For CI/CD or scripted setup:

```bash
# Skip agents
claudekit setup --no-agents

# Install all agents
claudekit setup --all-agents

# Install specific agents
claudekit setup --agents jest-expert,postgres-expert,vite-expert

# Install with defaults (core + jest + postgres + vite)
claudekit setup --default-agents
```

## Summary

The final experience provides:
- **Clear skip option** upfront
- **Simple three-choice initial screen**
- **Tool-specific selection** for those who want it
- **Multiple skip points** for easy exit
- **Fast defaults** for typical users

This ensures users who don't want agents can skip quickly, while those who do want them get a tailored selection.
