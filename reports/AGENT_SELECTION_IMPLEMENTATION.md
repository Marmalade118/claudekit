# Agent Selection Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. Created Agent Selection System (`cli/lib/agents/selection.ts`)
- Defined universal agents (7 always recommended)
- Created technology stack bundles (TypeScript includes 3, React includes 2)
- Implemented radio groups for mutually exclusive choices (test framework, database, build tool)
- Added optional standalone agents (Playwright)
- Created `calculateSelectedAgents` function for hierarchical bundling
- Implemented `getAllAvailableAgents` for "Install All" option
- Added `getAgentDisplayName` for proper formatting

### 2. Updated Setup Command (`cli/commands/setup.ts`)
- Added three-choice initial screen: Select/All/Skip
- Implemented progressive selection flow:
  1. Universal agents (pre-selected)
  2. Technology stack (checkboxes)
  3. Tool-specific choices (radio buttons)
  4. Optional additions
- Integrated with the selection system from `selection.ts`
- Shows agent count dynamically

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Universal vs Technology-Specific Grouping
**Universal (Pre-selected):**
- Git, Code Quality, Oracle (GPT-5), DevOps
- CSS & Styling, Accessibility, Testing Strategies

**Technology-Specific (User chooses):**
- TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js
- Docker, GitHub Actions

#### Hierarchical Bundling
- Selecting TypeScript automatically includes type-expert and build-expert
- Selecting React automatically includes performance-expert
- Selecting PostgreSQL automatically includes database-expert
- No orphaned sub-experts possible

#### Smart Radio Groups
- Test Framework: Jest/Vitest/Both/None
- Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Both/None  
- Build Tool: Vite/Webpack/Both/None

### 4. Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests in `tests/lib/agent-selection.test.ts`:
- Universal agent defaults validation
- Technology bundle expansion
- Database selection with broad expert inclusion
- "Both" and "None" option handling
- Duplicate prevention
- All 24 agents availability
- Display name formatting

All 11 tests passing ‚úÖ

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Choice**
   ```
   üì¶ Select Agents (recommended)
   üåü Install All (24 agents)
   ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip Agents
   ```

2. **If "Select Agents":**
   - Universal helpers shown pre-checked
   - Technology stack as checkboxes
   - Tool-specific as radio buttons
   - Optional tools as checkboxes

3. **Smart Defaults:**
   - 7 universal agents pre-selected
   - Jest, PostgreSQL, Vite as defaults
   - Shows total count dynamically

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No overwhelm** - Organized grouping instead of 24 individual choices
2. **Hierarchical bundling** - Related experts stay together
3. **Clear mental model** - Universal vs specific, checkboxes vs radio
4. **Fast path** - Most users done in 3 clicks
5. **No missing dependencies** - Can't select sub-expert without parent

## File Changes

- **Created:** `cli/lib/agents/selection.ts` (210 lines)
- **Modified:** `cli/commands/setup.ts` (updated agent selection flow)
- **Created:** `tests/lib/agent-selection.test.ts` (117 lines)

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. Users can now:
- Run `claudekit setup` to experience the new selection interface
- Skip agents entirely if not needed
- Select all 24 agents with one click
- Or carefully choose only the agents matching their stack

The system correctly handles:
- TypeScript bundling (3 agents)
- React bundling (2 agents)
- Database broad expert inclusion
- Test framework selection
- Build tool selection
- Optional additions like Docker and Playwright
