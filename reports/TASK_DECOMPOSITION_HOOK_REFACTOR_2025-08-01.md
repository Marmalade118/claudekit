# Task Decomposition Summary: Hook Naming Refactor

**Generated**: 2025-08-01  
**Source Specification**: specs/refactor-hook-naming-and-split-validation.md  
**Task Management System**: STM (Simple Task Master)

## Overview

Successfully decomposed the hook naming refactor specification into 15 actionable tasks across 3 phases. The refactor will provide clearer hook names that communicate scope and split the monolithic project-validation hook into focused, single-purpose hooks.

## Task Summary

### Total Tasks Created: 15

**Phase Breakdown:**
- Phase 1 (Core Implementation): 6 tasks (IDs 51-56)
- Phase 2 (Documentation and UI): 4 tasks (IDs 57-60)  
- Phase 3 (Testing and Polish): 5 tasks (IDs 61-65)

**Task Sizes:**
- Small: 4 tasks
- Medium: 9 tasks
- Large: 1 task
- Variable: 1 task

### Critical Path

1. **Parallel Start**: Tasks 51-54 can begin immediately in parallel
   - Create three new project-wide hooks
   - Rename existing hook files

2. **Registry Update**: Task 55 depends on tasks 51-54
   - Must wait for all hooks to be created/renamed

3. **Documentation Phase**: Tasks 57-60 can run mostly in parallel
   - UI updates depend on registry (task 55)
   - Other documentation tasks are independent

4. **Testing Phase**: Tasks 61-63 depend on implementation
   - Can begin as soon as relevant implementation is done
   - Manual testing (63) requires all implementation complete

5. **Final Tasks**: 
   - Performance validation (64) requires working implementation
   - Bug fixes (65) depend on test results

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1:**
- Tasks 51, 52, 53 (new hooks) - No dependencies
- Task 54 (file renaming) - No dependencies
- Task 56 (remove old hook) - Depends only on new hooks

**Phase 2:**
- All documentation tasks (58, 59, 60) can run in parallel
- UI update (57) can start after registry update

**Phase 3:**
- Unit tests (61) and integration tests (62) can run in parallel
- Performance testing (64) can run independently

## Key Implementation Details Preserved

Each STM task contains:
- ✅ Complete code implementations from the specification
- ✅ All technical requirements and details
- ✅ Full acceptance criteria for validation
- ✅ Proper dependency tracking
- ✅ Appropriate tags for filtering and organization

## Execution Strategy

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Start with parallel implementation** (Day 1-2):
   ```bash
   # View all Phase 1 tasks
   stm list --tags phase1 --status pending
   
   # Start implementing new hooks in parallel
   stm update 51 --status in_progress
   stm update 52 --status in_progress
   stm update 53 --status in_progress
   ```

2. **Documentation can begin early** (Day 2-3):
   ```bash
   # Start documentation updates
   stm list --tags phase2,documentation --status pending
   ```

3. **Testing throughout** (Day 3-4):
   ```bash
   # Run tests as features complete
   stm list --tags phase3,testing --status pending
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed task breakdown: `specs/refactor-hook-naming-tasks.md`
2. Start implementation with: `stm show 51` (or any task ID)
3. Track progress with: `stm list --status pending --tags phase1`
4. Update task status as work progresses

## Quality Metrics

- All tasks include complete implementation details (no summaries)
- Dependencies properly mapped for efficient execution
- Each task is self-contained and actionable
- Testing integrated throughout the process
- Clear acceptance criteria for validation

## Command Reference

```bash
# View all refactor tasks
stm list --grep "hook" --status pending

# Check task details
stm show [task-id]

# Update task status
stm update [task-id] --status in_progress
stm update [task-id] --status done

# Filter by phase
stm list --tags phase1
stm list --tags phase2
stm list --tags phase3
```

## Success Indicators

✅ 15 tasks created in STM with full implementation details  
✅ Task breakdown document saved to specs directory  
✅ All code blocks and technical requirements preserved  
✅ Dependencies properly tracked  
✅ Parallel execution opportunities identified  
✅ No "as specified" or reference-only content in tasks
