# Domain Expert Subagents Research Tasks Summary

## Overview
This document tracks all 22 research tasks created for developing the domain expert subagents suite. Each task follows the comprehensive research playbook structure.

## Research Playbook Structure
Each task includes:
1. **Define Scope and Boundaries** - One-sentence scope, 5-15 recurring problems, sub-domain mapping
2. **Build Topic Map** - 3-6 problem categories with errors, fixes (1-2-3), diagnostics, validation
3. **Environment Detection** - Version, framework, and configuration detection methods
4. **Source Material** - Prioritized official documentation
5. **Content Matrix Structure** - CSV/JSON format for data collection
6. **Canonical Template Requirements** - Frontmatter, Step 0, validation, safety rules
7. **Distillation Guidelines** - Focus on non-obvious patterns
8. **Deliverables** - Research doc, content matrix, final agent file

## Research Task Commands

### View a specific task:
```bash
stm show [task-id]
```

### Update task status:
```bash
stm update [task-id] -s in-progress  # Start working on task
stm update [task-id] -s done         # Mark task as complete
```

### List all research tasks:
```bash
stm list -t research
```

### Filter by phase:
```bash
stm list -t phase1
stm list -t phase2
```

### Filter by domain:
```bash
stm list -t react
stm list -t testing
stm list -t database
```

## Research Execution Process

For each task:

1. **Start Research**
   ```bash
   stm update [task-id] -s in-progress
   ```

2. **Gather Content**
   - Review official documentation
   - Identify common problems and solutions
   - Collect diagnostic commands
   - Find best practices and patterns

3. **Create Deliverables**
   - Research document: `reports/agent-research/[domain]/[name]-research.md`
   - Content matrix: `reports/agent-research/[domain]/[name]-matrix.csv`
   - Final agent: `src/agents/[domain]/[name].md`

4. **Complete Task**
   ```bash
   stm update [task-id] -s done
   ```

## Quality Checklist

Before marking a research task as complete, ensure:

- [ ] Scope clearly defined (1 sentence)

## Notes

- TypeScript expert already exists as MVP (src/agents/typescript/expert.md)
- Research tasks follow the comprehensive playbook from docs/subagents-principles.md
- All agents should use the canonical template structure from typescript-expert
- Focus on distilling non-obvious knowledge and practical playbooks
- Ensure all diagnostic commands are safe and one-shot only
