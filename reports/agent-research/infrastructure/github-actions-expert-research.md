## Key Technical Patterns

### 1. Workflow Structure Best Practices

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1' # Weekly security scan

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### 2. Advanced Caching Strategies

```yaml
# Multi-level caching
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      node_modules
      ~/.cache/yarn
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json', '**/yarn.lock') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-deps-

# Build cache
- name: Cache build output
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      dist
      .next/cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-
```

### 3. Security Hardening Patterns

```yaml
# Minimal permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: read

# OIDC authentication
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws-region: us-east-1

# Pin actions to specific SHA
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11 # v4.1.1
```

### 4. Custom Action Development

#### JavaScript Action Structure
```javascript
// action.yml
name: 'Custom Action'
description: 'Example custom action'
inputs:
  input-param:
    description: 'Input parameter'
    required: true
runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'index.js'

// index.js
const core = require('@actions/core');
const github = require('@actions/github');

async function run() {
  try {
    const inputParam = core.getInput('input-param');
    // Action logic here
    core.setOutput('result', 'success');
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
```

#### Docker Action Pattern
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
COPY . .
RUN npm ci --only=production
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/index.js"]
```

### 5. Reusable Workflows

```yaml
# .github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
name: Reusable Deploy
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      deploy-key:
        required: true

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
        env:
          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.deploy-key }}

# Usage in another workflow
jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
    with:
      environment: staging
    secrets:
      deploy-key: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

## Advanced Configuration Patterns

### 1. Dynamic Matrix Generation

```yaml
jobs:
  generate-matrix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - id: set-matrix
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ github.event_name }}" == "pull_request" ]]; then
            echo "matrix=[\"16\", \"18\"]" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "matrix=[\"16\", \"18\", \"20\"]" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

  test:
    needs: generate-matrix
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ${{ fromJson(needs.generate-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Deployments

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: 
      name: ${{ github.ref_name == 'main' && 'production' || 'staging' }}
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        id: deploy
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ github.environment }}" == "production" ]]; then
            echo "url=https://prod.example.com" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "url=https://staging.example.com" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
```

### 3. Conditional Job Execution

```yaml
jobs:
  changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      backend: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.backend }}
      frontend: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.frontend }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v3
        id: changes
        with:
          filters: |
            backend:
              - 'api/**'
              - 'backend/**'
            frontend:
              - 'web/**'
              - 'frontend/**'

  test-backend:
    needs: changes
    if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.backend == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Backend tests"

  test-frontend:
    needs: changes
    if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.frontend == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Frontend tests"
```
