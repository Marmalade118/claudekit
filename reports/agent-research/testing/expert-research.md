## Framework-Specific Research

### Jest Documentation Analysis

#### Core Testing Patterns
- Test organization with `describe` and `test` blocks
- Setup and teardown with `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`
- Assertion methods and matchers
- Mock functions and module mocking

#### Flaky Test Debugging
From Jest docs:
- Use `--runInBand` to run tests serially
- `--detectLeaks` to find memory leaks
- `--forceExit` for hanging processes
- Timer mocking with `jest.useFakeTimers()`

#### Mock Strategies
- `jest.fn()` for function mocks
- `jest.spyOn()` for spying on existing methods
- `jest.mock()` for module mocking
- Manual mocks in `__mocks__` directory

#### Async Testing

## Key Insights for Agent Development

### Non-Obvious Patterns
1. **Flaky Test Root Causes**: Often timing-related but manifest as logic errors
2. **Mock Strategy Selection**: Depends more on coupling than complexity
3. **Coverage Interpretation**: High coverage â‰  good tests
4. **Async Testing**: Most issues stem from uncontrolled side effects
5. **E2E Reliability**: Auto-waiting is more effective than explicit waits

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Deterministic Execution**: Tests should produce same results every time
3. **Clear Failure Messages**: Tests should explain what went wrong
4. **Maintainable Structure**: Tests should be easy to update
5. **Performance Awareness**: Tests should run reasonably fast

### Common Anti-Patterns to Address
1. **Testing Implementation Details**: Focus on behavior, not internals
2. **Over-Mocking**: Mock only external dependencies
3. **Shared Test State**: Avoid global state in tests
4. **Integration Test Overuse**: Follow the testing pyramid
5. **Coverage Gaming**: Don't optimize for coverage metrics alone
