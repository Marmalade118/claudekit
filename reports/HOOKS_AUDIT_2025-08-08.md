# Comprehensive Audit of cli/hooks Implementation

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals critical security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and architectural flaws throughout the hooks implementation. Most notably, **command injection vulnerabilities** exist in multiple files, allowing arbitrary code execution through user-controlled configuration.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Command Injection (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Affected Files:** utils.ts, lint-changed.ts, test-changed.ts, all project hooks

- **utils.ts:85**: Args joined with spaces and passed to shell without escaping
- **utils.ts:176**: Direct string interpolation in find command
- **lint-changed.ts:79**: File paths wrapped in quotes but still vulnerable
- **test-changed.ts:44**: Test file paths passed directly to command
- **All project hooks**: Config commands executed without validation

**Impact:** Attackers could execute arbitrary commands by crafting malicious file names or configuration values.

### 2. Path Traversal
**Affected Files:** utils.ts, check-todos.ts

- **utils.ts:180**: Joining paths without validation
- **check-todos.ts:23**: Incomplete tilde expansion (only handles `~`, not `~user`)

## Memory and Performance Issues

### 1. Memory Exhaustion Risks
- **utils.ts:90**: 10MB buffer limit could be exceeded
- **check-todos.ts:64**: Reads entire transcript into memory (could be GBs)
- **logging.ts:176**: Loads entire log file to get last N entries

### 2. Performance Inefficiencies
- **create-checkpoint.ts:70-75**: Multiple git commands in loop
- **lint-changed.ts:48-52**: Sequential file checks instead of parallel
- **test-changed.ts:89-93**: Sequential file existence checks
- **check-any-changed.ts:43**: Regex compiled on every line
- **logging.ts:118-120**: Uses O(n) shift() operation

### 3. No Caching
- ESLint/TypeScript availability checked on every run
- No incremental compilation for TypeScript
- Package manager detection repeated unnecessarily

## Architectural Issues

### 1. Race Conditions
- **create-checkpoint.ts:27-41**: Files could change between add and stash
- **logging.ts:68-75**: Multiple processes could corrupt stats file
- **runner.ts:94,101**: Environment variable mutations not thread-safe

### 2. Error Handling Failures
- **base.ts:51**: No try-catch around async run method
- **runner.ts:97**: hook.run() could throw and crash process
- **utils.ts:17-24**: readStdin has no error handling
- Silent failures throughout (empty catch blocks)

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- Unsafe type assertions without validation in multiple files
- Missing schema validation for user inputs
- Config values cast without checking

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Duplicate Code
- **utils.ts**: Two different stdin reading functions (lines 17-24, 201-220)
- Common patterns repeated across hooks without abstraction

### 2. Inconsistent Error Detection
- **lint-changed.ts:88**: Checks for string "error" in output (fragile)
- **test-project.ts:21**: Searches for "test" string in raw JSON

### 3. Missing Features
- No plugin system for custom hooks
- No hook discovery mechanism
- No cleanup for old logs
- No log rotation

## Specific File Issues

### base.ts
- Path validation missing before findProjectRoot
- Timeout merging logic overly complex
- Debug output could leak sensitive data

### utils.ts
- findFiles function vulnerable to command injection
- Multiple unsafe type assertions
- No input validation for JSON operations

### logging.ts
- Floating-point precision errors in average calculation
- No file locking for concurrent access
- Unbounded log growth

### runner.ts
- Hardcoded hook registration
- Empty catch blocks hide errors
- Debug output to stderr interferes with hooks

### create-checkpoint.ts
- Stash index calculation bug (indices change after dropping)
- No error handling if stash create fails

### check-todos.ts
- Inefficient line-by-line JSON parsing
- Path expansion incomplete

### Registry/Index
- Static registry prevents dynamic loading
- No API versioning
- Exposes internal utilities

## Untested Scenarios

1. Concurrent hook execution
2. Large file handling (>10MB)
3. Network filesystem operations
4. Symbolic link handling
5. Non-UTF8 file encodings
6. Interrupted operations
7. Disk full conditions
8. Permission errors
9. Git repository corruption
10. Malformed configuration files

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Security)
1. **Replace exec with spawn** to prevent command injection
2. **Validate all user inputs** before use
3. **Escape shell arguments** properly
4. **Add path traversal protection**

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Add proper error handling** with try-catch blocks
2. **Implement file locking** for concurrent access
3. **Add input validation** with zod schemas
4. **Cache frequently checked values** (ESLint/TSC availability)
5. **Use streaming** for large file operations

### Long-term Architecture
1. **Implement plugin system** for custom hooks
2. **Add hook discovery** mechanism
3. **Create abstraction layer** for common operations
4. **Add comprehensive logging** with levels
5. **Implement cleanup strategies** for logs and caches
6. **Add timeout enforcement** at runner level
7. **Create integration test suite**

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Use Promise.all** for parallel operations
2. **Implement incremental TypeScript** compilation
3. **Add circular buffer** for recent executions
4. **Stream large files** instead of loading to memory
5. **Compile regexes once** outside loops

## Conclusion

The hooks implementation has significant security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. The command injection vulnerabilities are particularly concerning as they could allow arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the lack of proper error handling, concurrent access protection, and resource management could lead to data corruption and system instability.

Priority should be given to fixing security vulnerabilities, followed by improving error handling and resource management. The architectural improvements can be implemented gradually to improve maintainability and extensibility.
