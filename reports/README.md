## Naming Conventions

Reports follow these naming patterns:
- Feature reports: `FEATURE_[NAME]_REPORT.md`
- Test results: `TEST_RESULTS_[DATE].md`
- Performance: `PERFORMANCE_[METRIC]_[DATE].md`
- Validations: `[TYPE]_VALIDATION_[DATE].md`

Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format for historical tracking.

## Purpose

These reports serve as:
1. **Development history** - Track feature implementation progress
2. **Quality assurance** - Document testing and validation results
3. **Performance tracking** - Monitor system performance over time
4. **Knowledge base** - Preserve technical decisions and findings
