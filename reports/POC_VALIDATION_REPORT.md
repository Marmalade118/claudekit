# Embedded Hooks System POC - Validation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-30
**Status**: ✅ POC Successfully Implemented

## Executive Summary

The embedded hooks system proof-of-concept has been successfully implemented, demonstrating the feasibility of TypeScript-based hooks as a separate binary with configuration support and Claude Code integration.

## POC Success Criteria Validation

### 1. ✅ Can execute as separate binary
- Binary created at `bin/claudekit-hooks-poc`
- Successfully runs via `claudekit-hooks auto-checkpoint`
- Available in PATH after `npm link`

### 2. ✅ Can read Claude Code JSON from stdin
- `readStdin()` function implemented with 1-second timeout
- Successfully handles piped input
- Returns empty string on timeout as specified

### 3. ✅ Can load and respect configuration
- Loads config from `.claudekit/config.json`
- Respects custom prefix setting
- Uses default values when config missing
- Handles invalid JSON gracefully

### 4. ✅ Returns proper exit codes
- Exit code 0: Success scenarios (checkpoint created, no changes, not a git repo)
- Exit code 1: Error scenarios (git command failures)
- All exit codes verified in test script

### 5. ✅ Works with Claude Code hooks
- Integration documented in `examples/claude-settings-poc.json`
- Stop event configuration with universal matcher
- Command format compatible with Claude Code

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created/Modified
1. **cli/hooks-poc.ts** - Main TypeScript implementation
2. **bin/claudekit-hooks-poc** - Binary wrapper
3. **package.json** - Added binary entry and build script
4. **.claudekit/config.json** - Sample configuration
5. **test-poc.sh** - Comprehensive test script
6. **examples/claude-settings-poc.json** - Claude Code integration example

### Key Features Implemented
- Git repository detection
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Timestamped stash creation with configurable prefix
- Working directory restoration after stash
- Configuration loading with defaults
- Proper error handling and exit codes

## Test Results

Manual test script executed successfully:
- ✅ Auto-checkpoint with changes
- ✅ No checkpoint when no changes
- ✅ Custom configuration respected
- ✅ Non-git directory handling
- ✅ Exit codes verified

## POC Limitations (As Designed)

1. Single hook only (auto-checkpoint)
2. No proper error handling beyond basics
3. No logging system
4. Minimal configuration
5. No automated tests
6. Hardcoded logic
7. Only checks current directory for config

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Gather feedback on POC approach
2. Validate performance is acceptable
3. Confirm architecture direction

### Full Implementation Path
1. **Refactor to proper architecture**
   - Extract BaseHook abstract class
   - Implement HookRunner for execution
   - Create HookRegistry for management
   - Add remaining 5 hooks

2. **Add production features**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Structured logging system
   - Automated test suite
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

3. **Performance optimization**
   - Command output caching
   - Incremental file checking
   - Parallel execution where possible

## Time Estimates

- POC Implementation: ~2 hours (completed)
- Full Implementation: 1-2 weeks
- Testing & Documentation: 3-5 days
- Total Project Time: 2-3 weeks

## Recommendation

The POC successfully demonstrates the core concept. The TypeScript-based approach with a separate binary provides:
- Type safety and better maintainability
- Easy configuration management
- Good integration with Claude Code
- Clear separation of concerns

**Recommendation**: Proceed with full implementation using the validated architecture.

## Conclusion

All POC goals have been met. The embedded hooks system is ready for full implementation based on the proven architecture and patterns established in this proof-of-concept.
