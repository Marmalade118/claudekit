- Runtime considerations and safety guidelines

### 3. Infrastructure Components

#### Agent Registry (cli/lib/agents/registry.ts)
```typescript
export const AGENT_REGISTRY = {
  typescript: { broad: 'typescript-expert', specialized: ['typescript-type-expert', 'typescript-build-expert'] },
  react: { broad: 'react-expert', specialized: ['react-performance-expert'] },
  nodejs: { broad: 'nodejs-expert', specialized: [] },
  testing: { broad: 'testing-expert', specialized: ['jest-expert', 'vitest-expert', 'playwright-expert'] },
  database: { broad: 'database-expert', specialized: ['postgres-expert', 'mongodb-expert'] },

  'code-quality': { broad: 'code-quality-expert', specialized: [] },
  devops: { broad: 'devops-expert', specialized: ['docker-expert', 'github-actions-expert'] },
  // ... additional domains
};
```

#### Validation Test Suite (tests/unit/test-subagents.sh)
