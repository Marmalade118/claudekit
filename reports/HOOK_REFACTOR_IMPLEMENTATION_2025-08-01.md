# Hook Naming Refactor Implementation Report

**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Specification**: specs/refactor-hook-naming-and-split-validation.md  
**Implementation**: Complete ✅

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the hook naming refactor specification, creating a clearer and more maintainable hook system for claudekit. All 15 decomposed tasks have been completed, tested, and validated.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation ✅
**Tasks 51-56 | Status: Complete**

1. **Created New Project-Wide Hooks**:
   - `typecheck-project` - Full TypeScript validation
   - `lint-project` - Full ESLint validation  
   - `test-project` - Full test suite execution

2. **Renamed Existing Hooks**:
   - `eslint` → `lint-changed`
   - `no-any` → `check-any-changed`
   - `typecheck` → `typecheck-changed`
   - `run-related-tests` → `test-changed`
   - `auto-checkpoint` → `create-checkpoint`
   - `validate-todo-completion` → `check-todos`

3. **Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Updated hook registry with new names
   - Removed monolithic `project-validation` hook
   - All files renamed using `git mv` to preserve history

### Phase 2: Documentation & UI ✅
**Tasks 57-60 | Status: Complete**

1. **Setup Wizard UI**:
   - Updated to display new hook names with clear descriptions
   - Hooks grouped by execution trigger (PostToolUse vs Stop)
   - Generated configurations use new `claudekit-hooks run <name>` format

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md, AGENT.md, and all documentation files
   - Created comprehensive hook reference guide
   - Updated all example configurations
   - Added clear explanation of naming convention

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation ✅
**Tasks 61-65 | Status: Complete**

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Created comprehensive tests for all three new project hooks
   - 37 new tests, all passing
   - Fixed TypeScript and ESLint errors discovered during testing

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Updated to use new hook names
   - Added tests for split hook functionality
   - Verified setup flow works correctly

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Verified all hooks execute correctly
   - Confirmed clear error messages
   - Validated configuration generation

4. **Performance Validation**:
   - No performance regression observed
   - Split hooks provide better granular control
   - Performance report generated

## Key Achievements

### 1. Clear Naming Convention
- **`-changed` suffix**: Operates on modified files only
- **`-project` suffix**: Operates on entire project
- **Action verbs**: Non-validation actions (create, check)

### 2. Improved User Experience
- Hooks immediately communicate their scope
- Setup wizard groups hooks by trigger event
- Documentation clearly explains each hook's purpose

### 3. Granular Configuration
- Users can enable/disable specific project validations
- File-scoped hooks for fast development feedback
- Project-wide hooks for comprehensive validation

### 4. Clean Implementation
- No backward compatibility baggage
- Fresh, maintainable codebase
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- 6 hook files renamed
- 3 new hook files created
- Registry and runner updated
- Setup command modernized
- All documentation updated
- Example configurations refreshed

### Test Coverage
- 37 unit tests for new hooks
- Integration tests updated
- Manual testing completed
- Performance validated

### Build Status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success
- ESLint validation: ✅ Clean
- All tests passing: ✅ 100%

## Usage Examples

### File-Scoped Validation (Fast Feedback)
```bash
# Triggered automatically on file changes via PostToolUse
claudekit-hooks run typecheck-changed
claudekit-hooks run lint-changed
claudekit-hooks run check-any-changed
claudekit-hooks run test-changed
```

### Project-Wide Validation (Comprehensive)
```bash
# Triggered on Stop event or manually
claudekit-hooks run typecheck-project
claudekit-hooks run lint-project
claudekit-hooks run test-project
```

### Action Hooks
```bash
# Workflow automation
claudekit-hooks run create-checkpoint
claudekit-hooks run check-todos
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Enable file-scoped hooks for immediate feedback
2. **For CI/CD**: Enable all project-wide hooks for comprehensive validation
3. **For Large Projects**: Consider disabling project-wide hooks during active development
4. **For Teams**: Document which hooks are required vs optional

## Conclusion

The hook naming refactor has been successfully implemented according to specification. The new system provides:

- ✅ Clear, descriptive hook names that communicate scope
- ✅ Split validation hooks for granular control
- ✅ Improved user experience through better organization
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples
- ✅ Full test coverage and validation
- ✅ No performance regression

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for use.
