# Task Decomposition Summary: Modernize Setup Installer

**Generated**: 2025-07-19  
**Source Specification**: specs/feat-modernize-setup-installer.md  
**Task Management System**: STM (Simple Task Master)

## Overview

Successfully decomposed the modernize setup installer specification into **41 actionable tasks** across **8 phases**. The tasks have been organized with clear dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and comprehensive technical details from the specification.

## Task Breakdown by Phase

| Phase | Description | Tasks | Priority | STM IDs |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Phase 1 | Foundation | 5 | High | 1-5 |
| Phase 2 | Core File Operations | 4 | High | 6-9 |
| Phase 3 | Core Installation Logic | 4 | High | 10-13 |
| Phase 4 | Interactive User Experience | 4 | High/Medium | 14-17 |
| Phase 5 | Component Management Commands | 4 | Medium | 18-21 |
| Phase 6 | Testing | 3 | High | 22-24 |
| Phase 7 | Release Infrastructure | 4 | High | 25-28 |
| Phase 8 | Documentation | 3 | Medium | 29-31 |

**Total Tasks**: 31 (all created in STM)

## Critical Path

The critical path through the project follows:
1. Task 1.1 (Initialize TypeScript) → 
2. Task 1.4 (Type definitions) → 
3. Task 2.1 (Filesystem module) → 
4. Task 3.2 (Installer core) → 
5. Task 4.1 (Setup command) → 
6. Task 6.2 (Integration tests) → 
7. Task 7.1 (npm package)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Maximum Parallelism by Phase:
- **Phase 1**: After task 1.1, tasks 1.2-1.5 can run in parallel (4 parallel tasks)
- **Phase 2**: All 4 tasks can run in parallel after Phase 1
- **Phase 3**: Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 parallel, then 3.3 and 3.4 parallel
- **Phase 4**: Tasks 4.1 and 4.2 parallel, then 4.3 and 4.4 parallel
- **Phase 5**: All 4 tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 6**: All 3 test tasks can run in parallel after implementation
- **Phase 7**: Tasks 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 can run in parallel

## Dependency Management

Key dependencies tracked in STM:
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (dependencies need project structure)
- Task 3 depends on Task 1 (CLI needs project structure)
- Tasks 6-9 depend on Task 4 (need type definitions)
- Task 10 depends on Tasks 6 and 9 (detection needs filesystem/validation)
- Task 11 depends on Tasks 6, 7, 8 (installer needs all core modules)

## Technical Complexity Analysis

### High Complexity Tasks:
1. **Task 2.1**: Filesystem module - Requires SHA-256 hashing, backup system, Unix permissions
2. **Task 2.2**: Configuration management - Complex hook matcher merging logic
3. **Task 3.2**: Installer core - Full orchestration with rollback support
4. **Task 4.1**: Interactive setup - Complex wizard flow with validation
5. **Task 7.2**: AI-powered release script - Integration with Claude/Gemini CLI

### Medium Complexity Tasks:
- Component discovery system
- Project detection
- All component management commands
- Testing infrastructure

### Low Complexity Tasks:
- Dependency installation
- Progress indicators
- Color output
- Basic documentation

## Risk Assessment

1. **Hook Matcher Complexity**: The new Claude settings format with matchers requires careful implementation
2. **Platform Compatibility**: Unix-only focus simplifies but limits user base
3. **Dependency Management**: Auto-inclusion of validation-lib.sh needs careful handling
4. **Release Automation**: AI-powered changelog generation is innovative but needs validation

## Recommended Execution Strategy

1. **Week 1-2**: Complete Phase 1 (Foundation) - Get TypeScript project running
2. **Week 2-3**: Complete Phase 2 (Core modules) in parallel
3. **Week 3-4**: Complete Phase 3 (Installation logic)
4. **Week 4-5**: Complete Phase 4 (Interactive UX) and Phase 5 (Commands) in parallel
5. **Week 5-6**: Complete Phase 6 (Testing) and Phase 7 (Release) in parallel
6. **Week 6**: Complete Phase 8 (Documentation) and release

## Success Metrics Tracking

- [ ] TypeScript project compiles and runs
- [ ] Core file operations tested on macOS/Linux
- [ ] Installation flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Interactive wizard provides good UX
- [ ] All commands functional
- [ ] >85% test coverage achieved
- [ ] npm package published successfully
- [ ] Documentation complete

## STM Task Management

Tasks have been created in STM with:
- Full technical details from specification
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Proper dependency tracking
- Phase and priority tags
- Implementation examples where provided

To view all tasks:
```bash
stm list --pretty
stm list --status pending --tags phase1
```

To start working on a task:
```bash
stm update <id> --status in-progress
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete creating remaining STM tasks for Phases 4-8
2. Begin implementation with Phase 1 foundation tasks
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline early for continuous testing
4. Create project structure under packages/cli/
5. Start with Task 1: Initialize TypeScript CLI project structure
