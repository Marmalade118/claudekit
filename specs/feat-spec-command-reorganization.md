**Archive Reason**: TaskMaster integration removed from claudekit

## Archive Notice

This specification described the integration of TaskMaster AI for persistent task management within the spec command suite. The implementation has been revised to use TodoWrite for all task tracking, removing the dependency on external task management tools.

The spec commands now work as follows:
- `/spec:create` - Creates detailed specifications
- `/spec:validate` - Validates specification completeness
- `/spec:decompose` - Breaks down specs into TodoWrite tasks
- `/spec:execute` - Implements specs using concurrent agents with TodoWrite tracking

For the current implementation, see:
- `/spec:decompose` command file
- `/spec:execute` command file
- `docs/spec-documentation.md`

# Spec Command Reorganization and Enhancement

**Status**: Draft
**Authors**: Claude, 2025-01-13

## Overview

This specification details the reorganization of the spec command suite to follow a consistent namespace pattern and the addition of a new command: `/spec:decompose` for task decomposition with TaskMaster integration, and enhancement of `/spec:execute` for flexible task execution. The complete suite will consist of four commands: `/spec:create`, `/spec:validate`, `/spec:decompose`, and `/spec:execute`.
